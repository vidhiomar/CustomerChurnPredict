# 😼📉 CustomerChurnPredict 💳🤖  
*Because customers leaving is rude, and we predict it.*

---

Welcome to **CustomerChurnPredict** 🎉  
This project uses **Machine Learning™ magic** 🪄 to predict which **credit card customers are about to ghost the bank** 👻💸.

Instead of waiting for customers to say *“It’s not you, it’s me”*, we let data do the talking 📊🗣️.

## 📦📊 Dataset 
We use the **Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction** dataset from Kaggle:

🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rjmanoj/credit-card-customer-churn-prediction  

It includes:
- Customer demographics 👥  
- Account & transaction details 💳  
- A **churn flag** 🚩

## 🧠💡 What’s Happening Here?

The notebook `CustomerChurnPredict.ipynb` does the following:

✨ Loads the data (politely)  
✨ Cleans the data (because messy data = messy life)  
✨ Performs EDA 📊 (aka staring at plots until insights appear)  
✨ Encodes & scales features 🔧  
✨ Trains models 🤖  
✨ Evaluates them like a strict examiner 📈  

End result?  
👉 A model that predicts **who’s about to leave before they actually do** 🏃‍♀️💨
